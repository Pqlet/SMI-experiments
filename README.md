# SMI-experiments

This repository builds upon the [VanessB/Information-v3](https://github.com/VanessB/Information-v3) repository and its mutinfo library, thus you should install it beforehand. If you have some issues with installation, tou can try installing from the fork [Pqlet/Information-v3](https://github.com/Pqlet/Information-v3.git).

The `Synthetic_tests_SMI.ipynb` notebook measures sets experiments on the synthetic data, i.e. with known MI (Figures 1 and 2).

The MNIST notebooks `MNIST-SMI.ipynb` and `MNIST-AEMI.ipynb` measure SMI and AE+MI on MNIST classification task (for Figure 3).

The `Plotting_MI_SMI.ipynb` notebook plots Figure 3.
